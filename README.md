# Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard is a browser-based interface created as part of my journey through The Odin Project curriculum. This is my seventh project and it focuses on building a styled dashboard layout using HTML, CSS, and grid-based design. The dashboard includes various sections such as a sidebar, header, user profile area, project management area, and announcements.

## How to Use

- 🖥️ The dashboard consists of a sidebar for navigation, a header for profile and search areas, and content sections for announcements and projects.
- 📊 The "Your Projects" section displays project cards with icons to interact with.
- 📬 The "Announcements" section highlights important messages.
- 📈 The "Trending" section shows a list of users with their respective project names.
